% author: you
% date: before it's due

% Input: 
% D = N by Nf discrete divergence operator
% G = Nf by N discrete gradient operator
% I = N by N identity
% phi = Ny by Nx matrix with porosity field
% m = compaction exponent
% pD = N by 1 column vector of dimensionless overpressures
% Grid = structure containing useful info about the grid
% B = Nc by N constraint matrix
% N = N by N-Nc basis for nullspace of constraint matrix
% fn = r.h.s. vector for Neuman BC
% BC = struture with releavant info about problem parameters

% Output:
% uD = N  by 1 column vector of dimensionless solid velocity potentials
% vD = Nf by 1 column vector of dimensionless solid velocities

Phi_m = phi.^m;
phi_m =spdiags(Phi_m,0,Grid.Nx,Grid.Nx);

L  =  -D*G;       % system matrix
fs = phi_m*pD;   % r.h.s.
flux = @(h) -G*phi_m*h;
res = @(h,cell) L(cell,:)*h - fs(cell);

uD = solve_lbvp(L,fs+fn,B,BC.g,N);
vD = -G*uD;
