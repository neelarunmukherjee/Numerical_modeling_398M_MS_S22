% Author: Superman
% Date: X.Y.Z
% Description:
% This function computes takes in minimal definition of the computational
% domain and grid and computes all containing all pertinent information 
% about the grid. 
% Input:
% Grid.xmin = left boundary of the domain
% Grid.xmax = right bondary of the domain
% Grid.Nx   = number of grid cells
% Output: (suggestions)
% Grid.Lx = length of the domain
% Grid.dx = cell width
% Grid.xc = vector of cell center locations
% Grid.xf = vector of cell face locations
% Grid.Nfx = number of fluxes in x-direction
% Grid.dof_xmin = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the cells along the x-min boundary
% Grid.dof_xmax = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the cells along the x-max boundary
% Grid.dof_ymin = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the cells along the y-min boundary
% Grid.dof_ymax = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the cells along the y-max boundary
%
% Grid.dof_f_xmin = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the faces at the x-min boundary
% Grid.dof_f_xmax = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the faces at the x-max boundary
% Grid.dof_f_ymin = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the faces at the y-min boundary
% Grid.dof_f_ymax = degrees of fredom corrsponding to the faces at the y-max boundary
% Grid.psi_x0 = reference location for streamfunction
% Grid.psi_dir = diretion of integration for streamfunction 
% + anything else you might find useful
%
% Example call: 
% >> Grid.xmin = 0; Grid.xmax = 1; Grid.Nx = 10; 
% >> Grid = build_grid(Grid);
