%% Common useful BC's
% Penetration - set normal velocities on all boundaries to zero
Grid.dof_pene = [Grid.dof_xmin_vx;Grid.dof_xmax_vx;Grid.dof_ymin_vy;Grid.dof_ymax_vy];
Grid.N_pene = length(Grid.dof_pene);

% Slip - set all tangential velocities on all boundaries to zero
Grid.dof_slip = [Grid.dof_xmin_vt;Grid.dof_xmax_vt;Grid.dof_ymin_vt;Grid.dof_ymax_vt];
Grid.N_slip = length(Grid.dof_slip);

% Solid boundary - no slip and no penetration
Grid.dof_solid_bnd = unique([Grid.dof_pene;Grid.dof_slip]);
Grid.N_solid_bnd = length(Grid.dof_solid_bnd);
